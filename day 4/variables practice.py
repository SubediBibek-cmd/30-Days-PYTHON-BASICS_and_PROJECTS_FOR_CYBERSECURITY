# today we will practice  variables with some new attribues and  inputs that  will be useful for us in the future


#take your first name as a variable and last name , then print to the console "your name is _____"
# here we will use 2 new input forms as fname for first name variable and lname for last name variable


#fname and lname are the variables  that take a first name and last name
fname  = input("What is your first name ?")
lname = input("What is your last name ?")

print ("Your name is " + fname + " " + lname )
